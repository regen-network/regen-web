  title: Fund Strategy
  body: Regen Network is a community dedicated to building the
    Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) markets and foundational climate
    finance infrastructure to regenerate ecological health, with the carbon
    markets being our beachhead market. Launched in April of 2021, the Regen
    Ledger is our open-source Proof-of-Stake ecological blockchain, built on the
    Cosmos SDK. <br/><br/> The Regen Ecosystem Fund will focus on strategic
    early-stage investments to accelerate the adoption of Regen Network.This
    will create a vibrant ecosystem of companies using Regen Ledger and the
    $REGEN token as their backbone for ecological accounting, eco-credit
    provisioning, and Payments for Ecosystem Services.

  title: Fund Thesis
  body: >-
    Scaling PES markets by at least two orders of magnitude is imperative to
    meet the existential risk of climate and ecological collapse. We need more
    than a handful of startups to address these issues—we need an entire
    economy. Regen Network is poised—across its technical assets and community
    of builders and land stewards—to serve as the epicenter and springboard for
    this movement. The Regen Ecosystem Fund strategically invests in primarily
    software and high growth opportunities in the Regen, Cosmos or adjacent
    ecosystem in defi, dMRV and eco-fintech. 


    If the Fund is successful, it will drive the value of the $REGEN token. To keep LP incentives aligned and get them access to this potential upside, the Fund’s portfolio will partially consist of a crypto hedge fund, heavily composed of $REGEN tokens.
