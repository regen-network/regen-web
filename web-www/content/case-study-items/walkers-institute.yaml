  about: md//WIRRED is a Barbados-based nonprofit research hub, land reserve,
    consultancy, and community program center dedicated to the study and
    implementation of climate smart regenerative agroforestry practices. WIRRED
    works locally and globally to build resilient economies, ecosystems, and
    communities by creating disruptive design systems that increase

    md//For the last 50 years, Walkers Quarry provided sand to the island of
    Barbados. Sand quarries create air and water pollution, extensive land
    degradation, loss of natural habitats, and natural resource depletion. In
    2011, quarry management decided to transform extraction areas into <a
    href="http://walkersreserve.com/" target="_blank">Walkers Reserve</a>: an
    ecologically-thriving, forested ecosystem.


    Following permaculture design and management principles like rotational grazing and soil stabilization (<a href="http://walkersreserve.com/regeneration-manual/" target="_blank">among many others</a>), the quarry now provides habitat to threatened and endangered migratory birds, aids leatherback turtle conservation, sequesters carbon, helps fight climate change, grows perennial food systems, and strengthens the local economy to ensure a brighter future for the community.
  challenges:
    - text: The reserve has made steady progress since 2015, but WIRRED still requires
        a steady stream of conservation funding to complete the restoration of
        this sand quarry.
    - text: There is interest in showcasing WIRREDâ€™s work and evangelizing the
        potential for ecological conservation and restoration across the entire
        Carribean region, but they lack monitoring and verification tools.
approachSection:
  details: md//Using a combination of satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 and Planet
    Scope, Regen Network measured several ecosystem health indicators on Walkers
    Reserve, including land conversion, landscape diversity, carbon
    sequestration, and land regeneration index.
  results: >-
    md//**Qualitative:**

    - Ability to classify and track changes in land cover types including water, forest, agroforestry, herbaceous, vegetated dunes and bare soil.

    - Ability to quantify the changes in carbon (tons/ha/year) for each land management unit.

    - Used NDVI to create a trendline and conceptual framework for analyzing and measuring the land regeneration.


    **Quantitative:** >90% accuracy in classification and tracking, 7% YoY improvement.
  next: md//Improving the verification methodology accuracy, incorporating more
    ground truth data from 2020.

fundingSection:

  details: md//Creating a project on Regen Registry and storing monitoring data as
    immutable records on Regen Ledger which provides an important layer of
    transparency and accountability to funders.
  results: md//Project page on Regen Registry targeted to go live in Q4. Regen
    Ledger integration to be added in subsequent phase.
  next: md//Creating a dedicated carbon offset methodology for the quarry
    restoration. Launching the Project Page on Regen Registry and getting
    conservation funds to WIRRED.
conclusionSection:
  description: md//With promising results thus far, our pilot project with WIRRED
    is showing the potential Regen Network partnerships have to monitor, track,
    verify, and usefully store data.
