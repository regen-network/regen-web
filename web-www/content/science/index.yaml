    Regen Network is empowering an open community of scientists to build and deploy cutting edge methodologies to measure ecological health and make scientifically robust claims.
    

    Earth observation science, landscape ecology, and our ability to understand complex ecological systems is undergoing a technological revolution. Regen Network in the vanguard of this movement to make climate science available to the people and markets who need it most.
    

    Join us in service of better decision-making, better markets, and collective action on climate.

      description: md//The <a href="https://openteam.community/" target="_blank">Open Technology Ecosystem for Agricultural Management</a> brings together almost two dozen entities—including government agencies, research institutions, nonprofits, and corporations—to build open source tools that improve the ability of farmers and ranchers to make informed management decisions about their land in ways that result in increased landscape health. As a partner in this endeavor, we at Regen are contributing our expertise and technology regarding remote sensing of ecological indicators, durable and interoperable storage of ecological data, and governance of decentralized networks.
