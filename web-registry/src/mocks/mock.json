      "shortDescription": "For years, the land between Tsavo East and Tsavo West National parks in Kenya served both as home to a slowly failing cattle ranch and as the main migration corridor for local wildlife moving between the two National Parks. When we first encountered Rukinga, the community and the wildlife were at odds. Rukinga was a bruised, balding land, barren of wildlife. Cattle had grazed the fields into dust, poachers slipped on and off the ranch with ease, and trees were being clear cut along the area’s critical rainwater basin.",
      "longDescription": "In 1998, the local community supported our plan to establish the Rukinga Wildlife Sanctuary that covers 80,000 acres of forest. We established a community works project so local residents had an alternative income stream in place of poaching and clear cutting​. We brought on locally hired rangers and trained them to be wilderness guardians. We convinced the owners of the cattle to remove the cattle from the land to reduce conflict over resources.",

Stocking rate is adjusted frequently to match the feed available and growth rate of the plant. When managed well, this grazing system increases groundcover, biomass, plant diversity, animal and plant nutrition, soil health, water infiltration and soil organic carbon.",

They have a burning desire to succeed in agriculture and are very ambitious in the growth and development plans they have for Wilmot Cattle Co.\n\nWhile Stu has managed the day to day operations of Wilmot since 2016, and now presides over the portfolio of all three properties in a General Manager capacity, Trish works tirelessly behind the scenes ensuring a high level of rigor around the data collection, management, and analysis of every aspect of the business. They firmly believe that you cannot manage what you do not measure and as such, the integrity of the data is paramount.\n\nIn their spare time, they enjoy exploring the natural wonders of Wilmot, including its five waterfalls and large areas of virtually native bushland, with their two kids Harry and Poppy. They all gain great satisfaction from discovering new species of plants and learning about their role in the ecosystem.",

      "shortDescription": "The Pillango Project is a 1,101 hectare landscape rooted in an area that was once the world's second largest temperate indigenous grassland, the Great Plains of the U.S. Located in Wallace County, Kansas, Pillango resides at an altitude of 1,059m above sea level and receives an average annual rainfall of approximately 508mm. Pillango is situated in an area of the U.S. that has geographic significance due to its location above the Ogallala Aquifer, a vital water source that is rapidly depleting. In its original prairie form, the landscape was a herbaceous grassland rooted with native shortgrass prairie perennials. Over the last ten to fifteen years, the land has been cultivated as dryland corn and wheat. This has led to soil degradation, characterized by diminished carbon and water storage capacity. Despite this, the landscape has produced cropland-worthy yields under low rainfall conditions for multiple years, illustrating the underlying potential of its native soil bed.",
      "longDescription": "When Pillango’s owner Will sought to transition his Kansas cropland into climate beneficial production in 2019, he partnered with The Provenance Co (TPC). TPC is led by founders Julie and Leslie, siblings who grew up raising livestock on Kansas land. Julie and Leslie bring their institutional knowledge of regenerative agriculture and on-the-ground management experience to bear on the two biggest challenges properties like Pillango face when transitioning: degraded soil and lack of infrastructure to sustain animal, human and microbial life. Together, Will, Julie, and Leslie have been united in the philosophy that in order to restore life underground, one must simultaneously restore life above ground. TPC began implementing their proprietary land stewardship protocol, Regenerative Rewilding ®, in January of 2021.\n\nIn June of 2020, TPC began to work towards returning both human and animal life to Pillango. Jodi, an experienced farming practitioner raised on the fierce Western Kansas landscape, is the onsite crew leader. Dan, trained as an organic soil specialist, and Roberto, an expert herdsman with 20+ years of ranching experience, oversee livestock movement across Pillango land. Together, Jodi, Dan, and Roberto marry animal impact with soil restoration to rebuild the land's carbon sequestration stores. The onsite TPC team also includes Dan's wife, Cole, and their two children.",
