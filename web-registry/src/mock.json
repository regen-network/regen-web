Effectively mimicking natural herding behaviours, time controlled rotational grazing is the practice of moving large herds of animals across the landscape, grazing pastures for very short periods of time, allowing long rest periods, enabling adequate plant recovery. Stocking rate is adjusted frequently to match the feed available and growth rate of the plant. When managed well, this grazing system increases groundcover, biomass, plant diversity, animal and plant nutrition, soil health, water infiltration and soil organic carbon.",

This method is seasonally adaptive with proven benefits including increased soil fertility and water holding capacity, increased pasture density, composition and complexity, improved animal health and has led to increased stocking rates.  In addition, building the landscapes capacity for restoration provides the added security needed for making decisions that match stocking rates with land carrying capacity, with latest reports confirming Wongella stocking rates are double that of the South Burnett district’s average.",

      "shortDescription": "The Pillango Project is a 1,101 hectare landscape rooted in an area that was once the world's second largest temperate indigenous grassland, the Great Plains of the U.S. Located in Wallace County, Kansas, Pillango resides at an altitude of 1,059m above sea level and receives an average annual rainfall of approximately 508mm. Pillango is situated in an area of the U.S. that has geographic significance due to its location above the Ogallala Aquifer, a vital water source that is rapidly depleting. In its original prairie form, the landscape was a herbaceous grassland rooted with native shortgrass prairie perennials. Over the last ten to fifteen years, the land has been cultivated as dryland corn and wheat. This has led to soil degradation, characterized by diminished carbon and water storage capacity. Despite this, the landscape has produced cropland-worthy yields under low rainfall conditions for multiple years, illustrating the underlying potential of its native soil bed.",
      "longDescription": "<p>When Pillango’s owner Will sought to transition his Kansas cropland into climate beneficial production in 2019, he partnered with The Provenance Co (TPC). TPC is led by founders Julie and Leslie, siblings who grew up raising livestock on Kansas land. Julie and Leslie bring their institutional knowledge of regenerative agriculture and on-the-ground management experience to bear on the two biggest challenges properties like Pillango face when transitioning: degraded soil and lack of infrastructure to sustain animal, human and microbial life. Together, Will, Julie, and Leslie have been united in the philosophy that in order to restore life underground, one must simultaneously restore life above ground. TPC began implementing their proprietary land stewardship protocol, Regenerative Rewilding ®, in January of 2021.</p><p>In June of 2020, TPC began to work towards returning both human and animal life to Pillango. Jodi, an experienced farming practitioner raised on the fierce Western Kansas landscape, is the onsite crew leader. Dan, trained as an organic soil specialist, and Roberto, an expert herdsman with 20+ years of ranching experience, oversee livestock movement across Pillango land. Together, Jodi, Dan, and Roberto marry animal impact with soil restoration to rebuild the land's carbon sequestration stores. The onsite TPC team also includes Dan's wife, Cole, and their two children.</p>",
