      description: The Cosmos SDK x/authz module implements of ADR-30, allowing the
        granting of arbitrary privileges from one account (the granter) to

    - title: Fee Grants
      description: Fee Grants allow accounts to grant fee allowances, enabling others
        to use fees from their accounts, paving the way for farmers and monitors
        to file on-chain ecological claims without having to manage their own
        gas fees.

        trading, and retiring of credits pertaining to verifiable changes in
        ecosystem health. It’s designed to function as an open platform for
        credit designers, and will first be used for Regen Network's own
        CarbonPlus Grasslands credit.

    - title: Data
      description: The Data Module is intended to sit alongside the Ecocredit Module,
        serving as a flexible yet opinionated module for storing complex
        metadata and registering data schemas pertaining to a ecocredit batch or
        ecosystem service project.
