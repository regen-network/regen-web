    md//In the initial phase of this pilot, we are partnering with high-end
    chocolate brands in California such as <a target="_blank"
    href="https://imlakeshorganics.com/">Imlak’esh Organics</a> and <a
    target="_blank" href="https://endorfinfoods.com/">Endorfin Foods</a>, as
    well as <a target="_blank"
    href="http://yellow-seed.org/products/eco-cacao">Eco Cacao</a> and its
    parent organization <a target="_blank"
    href="https://www.conexionchocolate.com/esmeraldas/">UOPRACAE</a>, a
    co-operative of approximately 120 farmers from the Esmeraldas region in
    Ecuador. We hold the intention of scaling this effort to thousands of cacao
    farmers worldwide.


    Our partner in running this pilot is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.terra-genesis.com/">Terra Genesis International</a>, who has been helping Eco Cacao train their farmers on regenerative practices and establish the first regenerative cacao certification.

  description: md//Abundant monoculture crops to supply high global demand,
    severely degraded land and ecosystem.
  challenges:
    - text: High global demand for chocolate has led to highly-degrading monocrop
        cacao production that creates deforestation, runoff, and soil erosion.
    - text: Regenerative growing methods, for example cover crops, agroforestry, and
        crop diversification, can combat the problems of unsustainable
        production, but is often too expensive for local farmers to implement,
        and furthermore, their impact often goes unrecognized and uncompensated.
    - text: Unlike Organic and Fair Trade standards, there are no well-established
        regenerative agriculture standards nor verification methods necessary to
        get buyers on board for paying premiums that compensate and motivate
        farmers to adopt regenerative practices.
approachSection:
  details: md//Using remote sensing based algorithms provided by Regen Network,
    Eco Cacao can verify their implementation of polyculture vs. monoculture
    practices within cacao farms. Additionally, other land cover classes related
    to land use management and ecosystems health can now be identified with high
    accuracy, and provide additional insights into each farm’s vegetation cover.
  results: >-
    md//**Qualitative:** Detection of cacao monoculture vs. polyculture, primary
    and secondary tropical forests, mangroves, monoculture of African palm,
    Balsa and Teak, open water, constructions and other land uses.

    **Quantitative:** The area (i.e. number of hectares) per land cover class within each farm is identified with a 93% overall accuracy.

    regeneratively grown cacao.

fundingSection:

  details: md//Creating a project on Regen Registry and storing monitoring data as
    immutable records on Regen Ledger which provides an important layer of
    transparency and accountability to funders.
  results: md//Project page on Regen Registry targeted to go live in Q4. Regen
    Ledger integration to be added in subsequent phase.
  next: md//Creating a dedicated carbon offset methodology for tropical
    agroforestry systems and offering carbon offsets as additional revenue
    stream to premiums; Launching the Project Page on Regen Registry and getting
    much needed funds to these cacao growers!
conclusionSection:
  description: >-
    md//Remote sensing is a cost-effective way to verify regenerative practices
    within tropical agroforestry systems on a large scale. Further, using
    project-based funding with bespoke verification can provide an alternative
    route to funding this important regenerative work. This work supports the
    financial well-being of farmers and producers, and the viability of
    communities in Ecuador where cacao producers often struggle with low
    margins, pressure from development, and increasing climate-related risks and
    costs. This project incentivizes a shift towards ecologically sound
    practices, resulting in healthy land, cleaner water, cleaner air, and the
    mitigation of climate change.


    Future program development will focus on streamlining the verification process, growing market demand for regenerative cacao and creating incentives for landscape-scale regeneration based on a broader suite of land management practices inclusive of conservation and restoration priorities as well as diverse forms of regenerative agricultural production.
