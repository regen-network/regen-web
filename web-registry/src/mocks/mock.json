Managed grazing, which involves carefully controlling livestock density and intensity of grazing, has been shown to provide a wide range of ecosystem benefits such as enhanced carbon sequestration, improved soil health, and increased water infiltration. This methodology combines remote sensing data with in-field measurements to provide high quality estimates of soil organic carbon stock and measures additional ecological co-benefits such as animal welfare, ecosystem health, and soil health.",

Effectively mimicking natural herding behaviours, time controlled rotational grazing is the practice of moving large herds of animals across the landscape, grazing pastures for very short periods of time, allowing long rest periods, enabling adequate plant recovery. Stocking rate is adjusted frequently to match the feed available and growth rate of the plant. When managed well, this grazing system increases groundcover, biomass, plant diversity, animal and plant nutrition, soil health, water infiltration and soil organic carbon.",

They have a burning desire to succeed in agriculture and are very ambitious in the growth and development plans they have for Wilmot Cattle Co.\n\nWhile Stu has managed the day to day operations of Wilmot since 2016, and now presides over the portfolio of all three properties in a General Manager capacity, Trish works tirelessly behind the scenes ensuring a high level of rigor around the data collection, management, and analysis of every aspect of the business. They firmly believe that you cannot manage what you do not measure and as such, the integrity of the data is paramount.\n\nIn their spare time, they enjoy exploring the natural wonders of Wilmot, including its five waterfalls and large areas of virtually native bushland, with their two kids Harry and Poppy.

In order to mirror natural herding behaviors, time controlled rotational grazing optimizes the number of stock in a paddock, matches the grazing period with available pasture, shortens grazing periods in each paddock, and follows these activities by long resting periods to allow the pasture to recover. When managed well, this grazing system increases groundcover, biomass, plant diversity, animal and plant nutrition, soil health, water infiltration and soil organic carbon.",

      "shortDescription": "The Pillango Project is a 1,101 hectare landscape rooted in an area that was once the world's second largest temperate indigenous grassland, the Great Plains of the U.S. Located in Wallace County, Kansas, Pillango resides at an altitude of 1,059m above sea level and receives an average annual rainfall of approximately 508mm. Pillango is situated in an area of the U.S. that has geographic significance due to its location above the Ogallala Aquifer, a vital water source that is rapidly depleting. In its original prairie form, the landscape was a herbaceous grassland rooted with native shortgrass prairie perennials. Over the last ten to fifteen years, the land has been cultivated as dryland corn and wheat. This has led to soil degradation, characterized by diminished carbon and water storage capacity. Despite this, the landscape has produced cropland-worthy yields under low rainfall conditions for multiple years, illustrating the underlying potential of its native soil bed.",
      "longDescription": "When Pillango’s owner Will sought to transition his Kansas cropland into climate beneficial production in 2019, he partnered with The Provenance Co (TPC). TPC is led by founders Julie and Leslie, siblings who grew up raising livestock on Kansas land. Julie and Leslie bring their institutional knowledge of regenerative agriculture and on-the-ground management experience to bear on the two biggest challenges properties like Pillango face when transitioning: degraded soil and lack of infrastructure to sustain animal, human and microbial life. Together, Will, Julie, and Leslie have been united in the philosophy that in order to restore life underground, one must simultaneously restore life above ground. TPC began implementing their proprietary land stewardship protocol, Regenerative Rewilding ®, in January of 2021.\n\nIn June of 2020, TPC began to work towards returning both human and animal life to Pillango. Jodi, an experienced farming practitioner raised on the fierce Western Kansas landscape, is the onsite crew leader. Dan, trained as an organic soil specialist, and Roberto, an expert herdsman with 20+ years of ranching experience, oversee livestock movement across Pillango land. Together, Jodi, Dan, and Roberto marry animal impact with soil restoration to rebuild the land's carbon sequestration stores. The onsite TPC team also includes Dan's wife, Cole, and their two children.",
