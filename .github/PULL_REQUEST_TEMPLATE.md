#### Setting up backport PRs

After merging your PR to `master`, set up backports by doing the following:

1. If your branch does not have merge commits, add the following comment to
   your PR, `@Mergifyio backport redwood hambach`.

2. If your branch does have merge commits:

    a. Pull latest `master`, `hambach` and `redwood` branches

    b. Create new branches for backports and merge `master` (replace `<PR#>` with your PR #)
    ```
    git checkout -b hambach-backport-<PR#> hambach
    git merge master
    git push origin hambach-backport-<PR#>
    git checkout -b redwood-backport-<PR#> redwood
    git merge master
