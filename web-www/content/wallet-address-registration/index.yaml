  body: As we approach the mainnet launch of Regen Network, all REGEN (formerly
    XRN) token holders will need to register a valid Regen Network wallet
    address in order for your tokens to be allocated. YOU MUST register a Regen
    Network wallet address via this page by Feb 18, 2021. This is the only way
    to receive your token allocation.

    md//For security purposes, we require a photo of yourself (laptop or phone
    camera is fine) holding a piece of paper with the last 4 digits of your
    wallet address in writing in one hand, and one form of identification
    (drivers license / passport) in the other hand.


    Please follow the <a href="#" target="_blank">Regen Ledger wallet tutorial</a> to generate your wallet address, and make sure you adhere to the relevant security guidelines. This is the wallet that we will be sending your REGEN tokens to, and there is no way to recover those tokens should you lose access to the wallet.


    Once you have generated your Regen Wallet address in Keplr and clicked the "connect to keplr wallet" button below please click the recaptcha and fill out the form to register that address.
