  header: Regen Network wallet address registration
  body: As we approach the mainnet launch of Regen Network, all REGEN (formerly XRN) token holders will need to register a valid Regen Network wallet address in order for your tokens to be allocated. YOU MUST register a Regen Network wallet address via this page by Feb 10, 2021. This is the only way to receive your token allocation.

    md//For security purposes, we require a photo of yourself (laptop or phone camera is fine) holding a piece of paper with the last 4 digits of your wallet address in writing in one hand, and one form of identification (drivers license / passport) in the other hand.
    

    Please follow the <a href="#" target="_blank">Regen Ledger wallet tutorial</a> to generate your wallet address, and make sure you adhere to the relevant security guidelines. This is the wallet that we will be sending your REGEN tokens to, and there is no way to recover those tokens should you lose access to the wallet.
