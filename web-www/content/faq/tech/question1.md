The Regen Ledger provides the project three key elements, without which Regen Network’s promise to create a network dedicated to monitoring, verifying and contracting or paying for ecological health outcomes would be impossible.

**Data Verification.** Data provenance, and quality can be tracked and verified.

**Payments**. Using a blockchain allows Regen Network to facilitate direct payment for ecosystem services, as well as issuing trading & retiring of a whole new class of financial assets tied to ecological health, Ecosystem Service Credits.

**Smart Contracts.** Smart contracts allow for automation of the issuing of ecosystem service credits, or direct payment for ecosystem services, based on verifiable changes in ecological health.
