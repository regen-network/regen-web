## Installation

This project uses [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) with [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) to manage multiple packages:

- `web-marketplace`: Registry React application
- `web-components`: React components and [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) custom theme
- `web-storybook`: [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) config
- `web-auth`: React application used for Auth0 Custom Universal Login

### Prerequisites

#### Mac

If you haven't already, you can set up system dependencies by running the following commands:

```sh
brew install python
sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/python3 /opt/homebrew/bin/python
brew install vips
```

Note: `python` and `vips` are dependencies via `sharp`.

### Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
yarn bootstrap
```

Prepare some artifacts needed to run in dev mode:

```sh
yarn build
```

## Environment variables

Set variables in `.env` files in `web-marketplace/` and `web-storybook/` folders based on provided `.env.example` files.

For `web-auth`, follow these [setup instructions](web-auth/README.md#setup).

## Development

First, run:

```sh
yarn watch
```

It will watch for changes in `web-components` and rebuild them in `web-components/lib` directory.

Then, to run the registry app:

```sh
yarn start
```

To run Storybook:

```sh
yarn storybook
```

To run the auth app:

```sh
yarn start-auth
```

## Deployment

### Registry

Compile `web-components` and `web-marketplace` to `web-components/lib` and `web-marketplace/build` respectively:

```sh
yarn build
```

#### GraphQL Type generation

To generate Type definitions from our GraphQL Schema, as well as custom react hooks, make sure the [graphQL server is running locally](https://github.com/regen-network/registry-server/blob/5adc07f89c0d4ee74d65779cfad591025c8bebc2/README.md#starting-a-development-server), `cd` into the appropriate sub-folder and run (per repo):

For `/web-marketplace` there are two commands for the separate sources:

1. `yarn graphql:codegen` - for registry server graphql types
2. `yarn graphql:codegen-sanity` - for sanity CMS graphql types

which generates types for any **_named_** GraphQL queries and mutations in `web-marketplace/src/graphql/*.graphql` (note - it does not generate types for unnamed queries)

```sh
yarn graphql:codegen
```

This should be done anytime a `.graphql` file is created or modified.

As part of https://github.com/regen-network/registry-server/pull/186, we've added some additional filtering features to our GraphQL server (using [postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter](https://github.com/graphile-contrib/postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter)), though we restricted the filters to only work on certain fields and operators for now for [performance and security](https://github.com/graphile-contrib/postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter#performance-and-security) reasons:
https://github.com/regen-network/registry-server/blob/aa97096c9a8e88e1af97655586e0222e263b8df5/server/Server.ts#L111-L115

If you try to use a filter that is not allowed yet, you'll get the following error when trying to generate types:
`GraphQLDocumentError: Field "${fieldName}" is not defined by type "${TableName}Filter".`
In this case, you might want to submit a PR on https://github.com/regen-network/registry-server first to allow more filtering options.

Similarly, types can be generated for Sanity GraphQL Schema (from `web-marketplace/src/graphql/sanity/*.graphql`) using:

```sh
yarn graphql:codegen-sanity
```

### Storybook

Compile `web-components` and `web-storybook` to `web-components/lib` and `web-storybook/build` respectively:

```sh
yarn build-storybook
```

### Deploying the Custom Login form to Auth0

Please, follow [these instructions](web-auth/README.md#setup) and then:

1. Run `yarn build-auth` command.
2. Copy the code from `./build/index.html`.
3. Paste it into the Universal Login HTML form from [Auth dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/us/regen-network-registry/login_page) and save.

This could be automated in the future.

## Testing

```sh
yarn test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is used as test runner.

We're using [StoryShots](https://storybook.js.org/docs/testing/structural-testing/#using-storyshots) for snapshots testing.
Update web-components snapshots:

```sh
yarn test-update-snapshot
```

## Code style

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) are used as
code formatter and linter.

Code can be formatted and any auto-fixable errors corrected through the command:

```sh
yarn format-and-fix
```

If you are using VsCode, there are suggested workspace settings in `.vscode/settings.json.suggested` - copy those over to your workspace `settings.json` and things should format automatically.

Note: You'll need the VsCode extensions for [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

## Typography

This repo utilizes custom MUI Typography components to normalize styles with the mockups based on the typography in [figma](<https://www.figma.com/file/MuSpCtCdU2ns4cFAsPfvsx/Text-Styles-%26-Components-(current)?node-id=0:1>):

1. `<Title />` corresponds to "Header" text in the mockups
2. `<Label />` corresponds to "Button Text" in the mockups
3. `<Subtitle />`
4. `<Body />`

Responsive styles are generally normalized (e.g. an `H1` on desktop translates to an `H3` on mobile in most cases), however these can be overridden with `variant` / `mobileVariant` (for Titles) and `size` / `mobileSize` (for the others). For example:

```tsx
<Title /> // renders an h1 (default) on desktop, h3 on mobile
<Title variant="h3" /> // renders an h3 on desktop, h4 on mobile
<Title variant="h3" mobileVariant="h3" /> // renders an h3 on desktop & mobile
<Subtitle size="xl" mobileSize="sm" />
<Body mobileSize="md" /> // keep default `md` size on mobile
```

One small gotcha: due to how `styled` components and the `sx` prop function together, if you want to use a custom `fontSize` through `sx`, you have to pass responsive values:

```tsx
<Title sx={{ fontSize: 12 }}> // does not work as expected
<Title sx={{ fontSize: [12] }}> // works
<Title sx={{ fontSize: [12, 18] }}> // works
<Title sx={{ fontSize: { xs: 12 } }}> // works
```

All of these components also accept MUI's [SX Prop](https://mui.com/system/the-sx-prop/).

The `<Body>` component by default will add styles to child `Link` and `ul/ol` elements, which can be overridden through props:

```tsx
<Body>
  <Link>text</Link> // will render as green w/ bold text
  <ol>
    <li>list text</li> // will render with a green dot and custom positioning
  </ol>
</Body>
<Body styleLinks={false} styleLists={false}>
  <Link>text</Link> // will render as default text
  <ol>
    <li>list text</li> // will render with default list styles
  </ol>
</Body>
```

## Timeout Issue on Slower Connections

_some larger packages don't manage to get downloaded in time for yarn's 30 second timeout, you might see an error like this one_

```
info There appears to be trouble with your network connection. Retrying...
error An unexpected error occurred: "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/@material-ui/icons/-/icons-4.5.1.tgz: ESOCKETTIMEDOUT".
info If you think this is a bug, please open a bug report with the information provided in "/Users/jared/Dev/registry/yarn-error.log".
```

a simple workaround via https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/12432 is to run

```
yarn install --network-timeout 500000
```

instead of `yarn install`

## Netlify

Currently we use netlify to deploy this application.
Please see the `netlify.toml` in the project root for information about the different deployment environments.

### Debugging Netlify deploys

In case you are seeing a build/deploy failure from Netlify, there is a helpful way to debug.
Netlify provides the source code for [their build-image](https://github.com/netlify/build-image).
This docker image can be used to run a netlify build worker on your local machine.
This allows you to test settings and parameters of the build.
Hopefully this allows you to reproduce the error/failure you are dealing with.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/netlify/build-image
cd build-images
docker pull netlify/build:focal
./test-tools/start-image.sh ../regen-web/
```

Make sure that any changes you want to test in the local build are committed.
Uncommited changes are ignored by the Netlify build image.

After running the `start-image.sh` script you will drop into the docker container.
Then you will be able to run any commands, i.e. the build:

```sh
/opt/build-bin/build yarn build
```
