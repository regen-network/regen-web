RND may use any number of tools to collect information about you, your computer access points, and the web browser that you use to connect to our Site, including cookie, web beacon, pixel tag and clear gif technology. We use cookies and web beacons to identify your device, provide website user authentication, conduct fraud prevention and management services, distinguish you from other visitors, record your IP address and understand your use of our application, and identify the name of the website from which you linked to RND. This information is used for fulfilling contracts with our business partners, and to help us serve you better by improving our Site design, as well as our products, services, and promotions. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other web sites. Information obtained through cookies and web beacons may be shared with or obtained by service providers on our behalf.

A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a web site. A session cookie expires immediately when you end your session (i.e., close your browser). A persistent cookie stores information on the hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same web site at a later date, the cookie information is still available. A web beacon is a small string of code that represents a clear graphic image and is used in conjunction with a cookie.

When you visit our Site, we may use both a session and a persistent cookie. This RND-placed cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID) that is used to track your usage of our Site and in some cases, your email address. Your email address is only saved in this RND-placed cookie if you register with us. A web beacon allows us to capture certain additional types of information about a visitor’s actions on a web site, such as a visitor’s cookie number, the time, date, duration and number of page views, a description of the page where the web beacon is placed, and details about any items that were purchased.

If you register with us, this RND-placed cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our Site, and provides you with access to your account information.

If you have not saved your information with or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our Site in a manner that does not identify you. You can disable cookies at any time by using your browser options; however, if you turn off cookies, we will not be able to track your order or enable you to make a purchase from our Site. In addition, we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information.
