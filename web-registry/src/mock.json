Effectively mimicking natural herding behaviours, time controlled rotational grazing is the practice of moving large herds of animals across the landscape, grazing pastures for very short periods of time, allowing long rest periods, enabling adequate plant recovery. Stocking rate is adjusted frequently to match the feed available and growth rate of the plant. When managed well, this grazing system increases groundcover, biomass, plant diversity, animal and plant nutrition, soil health, water infiltration and soil organic carbon.",

In order to mirror natural herding behaviors, time controlled rotational grazing optimizes the number of stock in a paddock, matches the grazing period with available pasture, shortens grazing periods in each paddock, and follows these activities by long resting periods to allow the pasture to recover. When managed well, this grazing system increases groundcover, biomass, plant diversity, animal and plant nutrition, soil health, water infiltration and soil organic carbon.",
