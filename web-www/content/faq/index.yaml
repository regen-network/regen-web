      - question: How does your technology improve the ability to monitor ecological
          change?
        answer: "md//We bring together two cutting edge technologies: satellite driven
          earth observation science, and blockchain technology, to create the
          foundation of a new digital monitoring, reporting and verification
          system for ecological health. The foundation of our approach is open
          science and open source technology."
      - question: Who will use Regen Network?
        answer: >-
          md//**The World’s Farmers** - 37% of the total land area of this
          planet is engaged in agriculture


          **Researchers and Academics** - access to a global incentivized peer to peer ecological data market.


          **Companies** - to invest in their supply system resiliency, mitigate environmental degradation, or as an approach to corporate social responsibility.


          **Government Agencies** - to verify and support their land management programs and achieve their climate accord commitments.


          **NGOs** - Nonprofits have committed to specific aims to which they are legally and morally obligated to. Every year billions of dollars are spent on ecological projects.


          **Validators -** Validators run the nodes that secure the blockchain and earn fees and block rewards while ensuring uptime, availability and security for Regen Ledger users.

    questions:
      - question: Why do you need a blockchain?
        answer: >-
          md//The Regen Ledger provides the project three key elements, without
          which Regen Network’s promise to create a network dedicated to
          monitoring, verifying and contracting or paying for ecological health
          outcomes would be impossible.


          **Data Verification.** Data provenance, and quality can be tracked and verified.


          **Payments**. Using a blockchain allows Regen Network to facilitate direct payment for ecosystem services, as well as issuing trading & retiring of a whole new class of financial assets tied to ecological health, Ecosystem Service Credits.


          **Smart Contracts.** Smart contracts allow for automation of the issuing of ecosystem service credits, or direct payment for ecosystem services, based on verifiable changes in ecological health.
      - question: Why are you building your own blockchain?
        answer: md//Security, Governance, Scalability, Speed, and above all Usability.
          We are building as a domain specific blockchain using the Cosmos SDK.
          Building on the Cosmos SDK means we are in the cosmos ecosystem of
          zones and hubs which is creating a scalable and interoperable system
          of blockchains which can be programmed for specific use cases and have
          governance autonomy.
      - question: Why do you need a token?
        answer: "md//The REGEN token serves three key functions: to provide security, to
          govern, and to be used as transaction fees for Regen Ledger. The token
          also brings users together into a community of shared value: the
          mutual value of regeneration."
      - question: What is Regen Network's governance model?
        answer: "md//Regen Network’s governance model is Proof of Stake with a
          substantial upgrade: the Community Staking DAO allocation. The hybrid
          of pure PoS with an identity and reputation based community of
          organizations securing and governing the network will create a best in
          class trust layer for verifying, securing and exchanging natural
          capital assets."
      - question: Why are you using the Cosmos SDK?
        answer: md//Regen Network vetted every Open Source Distributed Ledger solution
          and Tendermint was found to have the right mix of security,
          deployability, and flexibility for Regen’s Ecological Domain use case.
      - question: Which protocols are you developing and why?
        answer: >-
          md//There are several criteria to be taken into account in protocol
          development. Technical feasibility, how it would compare to existing
          industry methods, how well the underlying data can encourage positive
          change in our ecology, whether there is existing market demand, if so,
          at what cost points, how much human ground truthing is required, and
          finally would such a protocol be positioned to actually influence
          current systems of production. With all of these factors in mind, here
          are some of the protocols currently in the works.


          Till / No-Till - highly feasible via satellite, little to no ground truth, strong market demand, has a great positive effect on building and maintaining soil health.


          Cover Cropping - highly feasible via satellite, similar to till/no-till in most respects.


          Crop Identification - also highly feasible, some market and policy value


          Pollinator Strips - very feasible, strong environmental/production/social benefits


          Fire Risk Assessment - satellite/drone, can track leaf moisture and fire breaks


          Riparian Zones - medium-high feasibility, extraordinary environmental benefits


          Erosion - medium satellite feasibility, needs more ground-truth, strong production


          Ocean Plastic - medium satellite feasibility, could easily identify cleaning crews


          Endangered Species - medium satellite / ground-truth balance, identify habitat


          Air Quality - satellite and IOT in urban areas, strong policy incentives


          Urban Trees - high feasibility with satellite, good policy incentives


          Above Ground Biomass - satellite feasible, could be used in a variety of programs


          Biodiversity Index - primarily satellite, more feasible with fixed-wing drones, policy


          Water Quality - also a policy piece, Satellite + IOT, and ground-truth


          Carbon Sequestration - requires a lot of initial ground-truth, however with sufficient amassing of data, possible shift to Modeling based on Satellite Imagery correlatives. Very strong market and policy demand.


          Polycropping/Agroforestry - might require more ground-truth/drones initially, and could perhaps be moved up into satellite. Huge ecological and social benefits.

    questions:
      - question: What is Regeneration?
        answer: "md//Regeneration is the growth of vitality, viability and evolutionary
          capacity of a system. As defined by our mentor Carol Sanford, the
          seven first principles of regeneration are: whole, potential,
          reciprocity, essence, nestedness, nodal, and development. You can
          [read more
          here.](https://theregenerativebusinesssummit.com/regeneration/)"
      - question: Why is it important to regenerate ecosystems?
        answer: md//Why is it important to refill your bank account?
      - question: Why is farming important?
        answer: md//Agriculture is the second largest global producer of greenhouse gas
          emissions. It’s also the critical industry supporting human
          civilization. And it’s becoming increasingly fragile, much more
          fragile than most people realize.
      - question: Why focus on land use?
        answer: md//All land is deeply connected in biological processes and weather
          patterns. You can’t just ignore parts of it, what you do in one place,
          is always affecting others. Our land usage habits are constantly
          feeding back into the ecology that produces our food, water, fresh
          air, and biological stability.

    questions:
      - question: Who is the team developing Regen Network?
        answer: md//To learn more about our team and partners, please view [the team
          page.](/team/)
      - question: Is Regen Network decentralized?
        answer: md//Regen Network’s decentralized backbone, Regen Ledger, is
          decentralized by design. The proof of stake tokens will be widely
          distributed and different organizations are already responsible for
          ensuring the success of the larger network vision. We are actively
          seeking members for our Community Staking DAO program, so if you are a
          developer, scientist, or land steward, please reach out to engage and
          support this network being as decentralized as possible at launch.
      - question: How would you describe the constellation of entities referred to as
          Regen Network?
        answer: >-
          md//**Regen Network** is the overarching whole. Although we often
          refer to ourselves as Regen Network, the Network is not an
          organization, but rather a community, a commons, a movement, a public
          blockchain-based protocol, and a network.


          **Regen Network Development, Inc.** is a Delaware C-Corp running the token sale to capitalize the development of Regen Network. Much of the team you see listed on the website are housed out of RND.


          **Regen Foundation** is a Delaware 501(c)(3) Organization. Regen Foundation focuses on the pillars of Open Science, Education and Capacity Building, and Technological Tools for the commons. Regen Foundation will govern 5% of the token supply of Regen Ledger as an independent entity after main net launches.
      - question: Are you hiring?
        answer: md//Check out our hiring updates

          position open, send us a note about yourself anyway -
          [office@regen.network](mailto:office@regen.network).
      - question: How can I get involved?
        answer: >-
          md//**Develop:** Use our open tech stack to build your own ecological
          application. Develop a new scientific methodology for verifying
          ecological state or quantifying ecosystem services.


          **Validate**: Run a validator on our testnets to grow your reputation and your XRN token holdings to make it into the active validator set at main net launch.


          **Invest:** There are two sales happening concurrently right now for the XRN token. The first is a Reg D token sale which can only involve US-based accredited investors as the SEC defines it. The second sale is a Reg S sale that excludes “US persons” from participating, and there is not particular accredited investors statute in those regulations, but the laws of the domicile of the investor must be adhered to. You can reach out to christian@regen.network for more information.


          **Partner:** Work with us to build the network through strategic partnerships.

      - question: When my project's CarbonPlus credits sell, how do I get paid?
        answer: md//Project developers create an account on the Regen Registry platform
          and provide their bank account or credit card. Once a buyer purchases
          a credit, a payment is made to the project developer’s account after
          deducting the appropriate fees.
      - question: What are the steps to register a project on Regen Registry and issue
          CarbonPlus Credits?
        answer: >-
          md//1. Register a Project.

          2. Submit a Project Plan. 

          3. Regen Registry reviews the project information for approval.

          4. Sign the Regen Registry contract.

          5. A dedicated Project Page is published on Regen Registry.

          6. Sign a Monitoring contract.

          7. Establish a Project Baseline - engage with a Monitor to measure the project baseline.

          8. Implement Land Management - implement the project activity(s).

          9. Monitor Carbon Stock Change - engage a Monitor throughout Crediting Term to measure the change.

          10. Verify - engage with a 3rd party Verifier to validate project data and monitoring.

          11. Issue CarbonPlus Credit - Regen Registry issues CarbonPlus Credits based on positive ecological change after Monitoring rounds.

          12. Get Paid - Sell your credits through Regen Registry. 

          13. Repeat Steps 9-12 for each CarbonPlus Credits issuance during the Project Term.
      - question: How is project data managed?
        answer: >-
          md//Regen Network aims to provide maximum transparency to CarbonPlus
          Credit buyers and other stakeholders by making the project
          documentation, including the Project Plan, Baseline Report, Monitoring
          Reports, and Verification Reports, publicly available on each Project
          Page. The data provided as inputs for the Monitoring and Verification
          process is not made public, but rather the outputs.


          *In order to provide Project Proponents with data privacy, the [Project Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wM6LND5SASmwlJ71PqEZZ_L8ECSxEDc0nl98978HRrI/edit?usp=sharing) permits the designation of certain information as “commercially sensitive.” This information will be excluded from the public version of the Project Plan that is made available on the Project Page on Regen Registry.*
      - question: How are CarbonPlus Credits issued for a project on Regen Registry?
        answer: >-
          md//Each CarbonPlus Credit represents 1 ton of CO2e removed from the
          atmosphere. 


          The approved Methodology for each Credit Class defines how each underlying indicator, such as Soil Organic Carbon, is measured. Regen Registry issues CarbonPlus Credits based on the difference between the latest monitoring round’s measurements and the measurements during the latest issuance event (or the baseline measurement if this is the first issuance). When there is an increase in carbon stocks between monitoring rounds, a Project Proponent can issue a CarbonPlus Credit. 


          Example: 


          If a Baseline measurement = 1000 tons of CO2e and a Monitoring round measurement = 6000 tons of CO2e after uncertainty deductions, Regen Registry will issue 5000 CarbonPlus Credits (representing 5000 tons of CO2e) to the Project Proponent. Since the 5,000 CarbonPlus Credits are subject to Buffer Pool and Permanece Reversal Buffer deductions, the Project Proponent will receive 4000 credits (after 20% deductions).


          See the Program Guide for more details.
      - question: What types of ecological change can Regen Registry monitor and issue
          CarbonPlus Credits for?
        answer: >-
          md//The CarbonPlus Grasslands Credit focuses on Soil Organic Carbon in
          grasslands and pastureland. 


          Other CarbonPlus Credits in development include forestry-based Credits (afforestation, reforestation, avoided deforestation, and agroforestry) and cropland-based Soil Organic Carbon Credits (no-till and low-till, cover crop, and crop rotation).


          In the future, Regen Registry will invite Credit designers and Methodology developers to innovate and design new Credits and Methodologies, subject to the approval and peer review processes required by Regen Registry.
      - question: Why should I purchase CarbonPlus credits from Regen Registry?
        answer: >-
          md//Financing carbon offsets / removals is a core component of climate
          action for companies and individuals. Climate commitments can help:


          1. **Deliver on Climate Action Goals:** Contribute to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement by making a direct investment in the low-carbon transition through supporting carbon removal projects.

          2. **Make an Impact towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals:** Regen Registry projects measure regenerative environmental and social co-benefits that deliver UN Sustainable Development Goal impacts.

          3. **Gain Recognition by Civil Society:** Companies are motivated to remove their carbon footprint and engage in credible climate impact strategies.

          4. **Make Climate Claims:** Purchases of carbon offsets / removals that are equivalent to or greater than your carbon footprint can be used to fulfill ‘carbon neutral,’ ‘climate neutral,’ and ‘climate positive’ claims.

          5. **Invest Directly in Farmers and Land Stewards:** CarbonPlus Credit purchases contribute 75 cents of each dollar directly to Project Proponents to continue and expand their ecologically postive land stewardship.
      - question: How is Regen Registry different from other programs that help land
          stewards receive payments for carbon removals and ecological services?
        answer: >-
          md//Regen Registry was designed from the ground-up with a team of
          farmers, ranchers, and land stewards to address many of the challenges
          with existing ecological payments programs:


          **Regen Registry Offers Low Project Costs**


          * Low Cost - significantly lower than existing registries, which require consultants to perform manual in-situ measurements; Regen Registry relies on automated remote sensing monitoring to streamline projects costs.

          * Minimal Registry Fees - Regen Registry charges a single fee for credit issuance. There are no account fees, project listing fees, transfer fees, activation fee, etc.

          * Share Upfront Project Costs - Regen Registry supports multi-party ownership of CarbonPlus Credits to enable the sharing of upfront costs between farmers, land owners and/or project developers. Further, through aggregated projects with multiple local farmers, monitoring and verification costs can be further streamlined.


          **Regen Registry Creates Additional Revenue Streams**


          * Premiums - Project Pages on Regen Registry tell the unique story of each land steward and ecological practice. CarbonPlus Credit buyers can explore projects with holistic ecological impacts, including carbon stock measurement, ecological co-benefits, and UN Sustainable Development Goal outcomes. Each project's ecological impact on Regen Registry is unique, which translates into premium CarbonPlus Credits.

          * Simplified Payments - integrated payment platform provides direct real-time payments, including credit card, bank, and mobile. 

          * Affordable Brokerage Services - Regen Registry offers affordable, optional brokerage services. 


          **Regen Registry Offers Time Savings**


          * Simple Project Registration - Regen Registry's simple registration involves a short intake form and project plan that can be completed in one sitting.

          * Monitoring Services - Regen Registry provides automated monitoring services that require only a minimal set of soil samples.
      - question: Do you accept methodologies from third-party programs?
        answer: >-
          md//Yes, we accept methodologies from the following programs:


          * Verra: VCS Program, CCB Program, Jurisdictional & Nested REDD+, SD Vista

          * Gold Standard

          * American Carbon Registry

          * Climate Action Reserve

          * CDM

          * Australian Emission Reduction Fund - Carbon Farming Initiative
  - header: carbonplus credits
    questions:
      - question: What is a CarbonPlus credit?
        answer: >-
          md//CarbonPlus credits are voluntary carbon credits. Each credit
          represents one tonne of CO2e removed from the atmosphere and stored in
          the soil or biomass. On top of carbon removal, credits also include
          ecological and social co-benefits, such as soil health, ecosystem
          health, and animal welfare.


          Both the carbon sequestration and the co-benefits are measured. The number of credits are issued solely based on the tons of CO2e sequestered, measured based on remote sensing analysis in combination with a limited set of soil samples.


          In the case of the CarbonPlus Grasslands Credit, Livestock emissions (N2O and CH4) quantification is based on the number of livestock and number of days they spent in the project area.
      - question: What are the CarbonPlus Credit terms related to greenhouse gas
          accounting?
        answer: >-
          md//1. **Additionality** - based on adopting a new activity from a
          pre-approved list which includes activities approved by either the
          Australian Government’s Carbon Farming Initiative or the California
          Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Healthy Soils Program (HSP).
          We accept adoption dates (the date the new project activity was
          applied) up to 10 years prior to project registration.

          2. **Permanence** - 25 year, either through covenant or dedicated reversal buffer (5% of each issuance)

          3. **Buffer Pool** - 20% of each issuance is allocated to a dedicated uncertainty pool (note, this is a separate account than the Permanence Reversal Buffer)

          4. **Leakage** - market leakage related to grassland management activities is likely to be negligible (de minimis) but if project proponents expect above de minimis rates, an appropriate discount factor will be applied during the GHG quantification.

          5. **Double Counting** - project proponents will be required to commit to not applying for credits for the same land and emission reduction/removal concurrently on any other registry / GHG Program

          6. **Verification** - an independent third-party verifier provides an assurance of the integrity of the data and information provided by project proponents and the monitoring process
      - question: Are CarbonPlus Credits securities or commodities?
        answer: md//CarbonPlus Credits are a commodity.
      - question: As a project developer, how much can I earn by issuing CarbonPlus
          Credits for my project?
        answer: >-
          md//CarbonPlus Credits returns are highly dependent on two factors:


          * Credit Price - which fluctuates with the demand and supply of the voluntary carbon credit markets

          * Carbon Sequestration Rate - which depends on land management and climatic conditions


          Example:


          We project average returns (net margins) of above 15% year on year, or $5 per hectare per yer. This assumes a price of $10 per each CarbonPlus Credit and a Carbon Sequestration Rate of 0.41 tC per hectare per year.


          *RND, Inc. cannot guarantee the above returns. It is the responsibility of each project proponent to perform their own due diligence.*
      - question: What are the costs to manage a CarbonPlus Credits project?
        answer: >-
          md//The costs for a CarbonPlus Credit project are:


          - **Monitoring**:
            - Soil Sampling  - soil sampling collection and lab analysis ($25 - $100 per sample)
            - Remote Sensing Analysis - quantifies GHG based on Soil Organic Carbon measurements and satellite imagery ($7,500 to $15,000 per monitoring round)


          - **Verification**: independent 3rd party auditor ($5,000 to $15,000 per monitoring round)


          - **CarbonPlus Credit Issuance fees**: Regen Network charges a fee for each credit issuance.


          - **CarbonPlus Credit Brokerage fees**: Regen Network charges a fee for optional brokerage services.


          *The CarbonPlus Credit Issuance and CarbonPlus Credit Brokerage fees are deferred to issuance and sale respectively, and therefore are not upfront costs. Regen Network does not fulfill the role of Verifier for projects where Regen Network is the monitor. This requires an external party, and fees associated are not charged by Regen Network Development, Inc.*
      - question: Is funding available for upfront project development costs?
        answer: md//Regen Network does not provide funding support for upfront project
          development costs. In the case that Regen Network secures forward
          contracts with CarbonPlus Credit buyers, Regen Network may consider
          supporting some projects directly.
      - question: How are carbon removals quantified?
        answer: md//Carbon removals are calculated using standard GHG accounting
          practices. Soil Organic Carbon percentages measured in soil samples
          are calibrated with [Sentinel
          2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2)
          satellite imagery in a given monitoring time period to calculate the
          changes in Soil Organic Carbon stocks from the baseline measurement.
      - question: Is soil sampling required for project monitoring?
        answer: md//Yes, a limited number of soil samples are required. The average farm
          will require around 25 samples per monitoring round, whereas larger
          farms may require 50-75 samples per monitoring round. Refer to the
          Monitoring Methodology document for each CarbonPlus Credit Class for
          further instructions.
      - question: Can historical project data be used to monitor and issue CarbonPlus
          Credits?
        answer: >-
          md//If the adoption date of the approved project activity is within 10
          years prior to project registration, we can accept historical soil
          sampling data as early as 2017. 


          CarbonPlus Grasslands Credits projects must follow the instructions provided in Regen Network’s [Methodology for Soil Sampling in Grazing Systems](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rn-BhjCxKHfnmenSqNcx0wW9j1_pNjXP/view?usp=sharing) to align with the monitoring protocol. If the monitor can verify that Soil Organic Carbon has been sequestered over these historical time periods, your project may be eligible for credit issuance for 2017 onward.
      - question: How are the CarbonPlus Credits ecological co-benefits measured?
        answer: >-
          md//In the case of the CarbonPlus Grasslands Credits:


          * Ecosystem health is based on the Costanza Framework, measuring its ability to maintain structure (organization) and function (vigor) over time in the face of external stress (resilience).

          * Soil health is based on Cornell University’s Soil Health Assessment, assessing micronutrients and macronutrients.

          * Animal welfare is based on adherence to national animal welfare standards that track nutrition level, access to water, social contact, and more key factors.



          *Guidance for additional ecological co-benefits measurement is forthcoming.*
      - question: Where can I learn more about the CarbonPlus Grasslands Credit?
        answer: md//Please review the [Program
          Guide](https://regen-registry.s3.amazonaws.com/Regen+Registry+Program+Guide.pdf),
          the [Credit
          Class](https://regen-registry.s3.amazonaws.com/GHG+and+Co-Benefits+in+Grazing+Systems+Credit+Class.pdf)
          and the
          [Methodology](https://regen-registry.s3.amazonaws.com/Methodology+for+GHG+and+Co-Benefits+in+Grazing+Systems.pdf).
      - question: What standards are followed for CarbonPlus Credits?
        answer: >-
          md//Regen Registry standards can be found in the Program Guide and the
          respective Credit Class for each CarbonPlus Credit.


          The Program Guide follows the best practices of GHG accounting, AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use) and SOC (Soil Organic Carbon) methodologies, including these well established reference standards:


          * American Carbon Registry (ACR) Registry Standard v6.0

          * The Australian Government’s Carbon Farming Initiative - Measurement of Soil Carbon Sequestration in Agricultural Systems - Methodology Determination 2018

          * Gold Standard Soil Organic Carbon Framework Methodology v1.0

          * VCS Standard v4.0

          * GHG Protocol for Project Accounting
      - question: Who are the Verifiers?
        answer: md//Regen Network accepts Verifiers who are already approved as
          Verifiers on American Carbon Registry, Verra, and Gold Standard. New
          Verifiers may apply to Regen Network for approval. See the Program
          Guide for more details.
      - question: Which activities are approved for the CarbonPlus Grasslands Credit and
          satisfy the additionality requirement?
        answer: >-
          md//Eligible approved activities include:


          * Any management activity approved by the Carbon Farming Initiative related to grasslands and/or grazing.

          * Any conservation practice approved by California Department of Food and Agriculture [Healthy Soils Program](https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/oefi/healthysoils/IncentivesProgram.html) related to grasslands and/or grazing.
      - question: What happens if a project loses Soil Organic Carbon in a given year?
        answer: md//Regen Network recognize that Soil Organic Carbon stocks fluctuate
          naturally, especially during extreme climatic conditions, such as
          drought. At the end of the project term we reconcile the Soil Organic
          Carbon stock level with the prior monitored level. If Soil Organic
          Carbon has been lost we use the Buffer Pool to accommodate the carbon
          stock gap. See the Program Guide’s Buffer Pool section for more
          details.
      - question: When are CarbonPlus Credits issued?
        answer: md//The first CarbonPlus Credits issuance happens after a new project
          has completed the baseline and two monitoring rounds, in Year 2 of the
          project. The Monitoring Methodology requires a minimum of six
          monitoring rounds in the 10 year Crediting Term. After each monitoring
          event, if there is positive change in soil carbon stocks since the
          last monitoring, projects can elect to issue CarbonPlus Credits.
      - question: Can projects be cancelled prematurely after they have begun?
        answer: md//Regen Registry allows projects to cancel prematurely. Please refer
          to the Program Guide’s Premature Termination section for more details.
      - question: What does the Project Page on Regen Registry include?
        answer: >-
          md//The Project Page includes:


          * Project description

          * Land Steward description

          * Photos and videos of the project

          * Key land management activities

          * Project Plan 


            *Project Pages can be customized.*
      - question: Do CarbonPlus Credit prices vary?
        answer: md//CarbonPlus Credit price is a function of demand and supply.
          CarbonPlus Credit price is also informed by the type and quality of
          each project on the Regen Registry.
      - question: Is Monitoring performed during the Permanence Period?
        answer: md//Projects that choose to utilize a Permanence Reversal Buffer (rather
          than putting the land under covenant) are required to complete a
          monitoring round at the end of the Permanence Period to reconcile
          carbon stock levels and address any carbon stock reversals that may
          have occurred. See the Program Guide’s Permanence Reversal Buffer
          section for more details.
      - question: Do I have to use Regen Network for monitoring?
        answer: >-
          md//At this time, Regen Network is the only approved monitor. 


          Regen Network invites 3rd party monitors to apply for approval to become Monitors on Regen Registry. Monitors must provide monitoring services based on the published, peer-review methodologies approved by Regen Registry. 


          See the Program Guide for more details.
      - question: Who are the approved verifiers?
        answer: >-
          md//The current approved verifiers are:

    questions:
      - question: How do I get REGEN?
        answer: md//REGEN are available on [Osmosis DE](https://app.osmosis.dex)X via
          Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) transfers and via the staking
          mechanism available on [Keplr wallet](https://wallet.keplr.app/).
      - question: What type of tokens are REGEN?
        answer: md//The REGEN token is a staking and utility token launched on our own
          Tendermint BFT powered blockchain. Transaction fees on Regen Network
          will be paid in REGEN, and additional fees in REGEN will be required
          for special actions such as creating a new ecocredit class on chain.
      - question: Are you listed on exchanges?
        answer: md//REGEN is currently listed on [Osmosis
          DEX](https://app.osmsosis.dex).
      - question: How many tokens will be created when?
        answer: md//During the Token Generation Event, which happened on Apr 15 2021,
          100,000,000 REGEN were created and distributed to the various wallets
          and contracts as dictated by the genesis file. Since then, the only
          Regen Tokens that have been added to the supply are through a
          mechanism referred to as inflation, which is a Proof of Stake
          mechanism to encourage token holders to stake their tokens and
          participate in governance.
      - question: What does REGEN allow me to do?
        answer: md//**REGEN is the native governance token of Regen Network. Assuming
          the token holders stake their tokens, the token allows one to
          participate in the governance of the chain, receive block rewards and
          receive their share of the inflation mechanism. As the native token
          for Regen Ledger, REGEN must be used to pay for transaction costs
          on-chain, commonly referred to as gas, which is required to transfer
          REGEN. Future utility of the token is connected to the issuance,
          governance, curation, auditing and exchange for eco-credits.**
