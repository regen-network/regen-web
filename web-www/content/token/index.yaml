    md//[Regen Ledger](https://docs.regen.network/) is a sovereign,
    proof-of-stake blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK. REGEN is a staking token,
    providing Regen Ledger with utility - namely, fees, gas, governance and
    security. 


    REGEN token is designed to ensure utility for ecological data and climate markets. Regen Network is governed as a public blockchain by token holders. 


    REGEN token will accrue value from transaction fees on ecological assets and other transactions originated and secured on-chain.

  title: Gravity DEX & Osmosis - Liquidity Bootstrapping and Reverse Dutch Auction
  subtitle: "Release date: June 2021"
  body: Early Regen community members are collaborating with the Osmosis team to
    make a liquidity bootstrapping pool on the Osmosis DEX in the next 60 days.
    This will be the first Cosmos ecosystem initial DEX offering (IDO). The
    liquidity bootstrapping pool (LBP) will use a variant of a reverse dutch
    auction mechanism that will support fair and sustainable price discovery for
    our community. After price discovery on the Osmosis LBP, we are working to
    ensure there is an ATOM-REGEN trading pair as soon as the Gravity DEX is
    live on Cosmos Hub.
